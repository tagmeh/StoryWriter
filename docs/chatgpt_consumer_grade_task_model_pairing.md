#### **2. LLaMA-2 (7B, 13B, 70B)**
- **Strengths:**
  - Strong logical reasoning and consistency in text generation.
  - The 13B and 70B versions are better for maintaining coherence in longer texts.
- **Best For:**
  - Story structure generation, character sheets, and filling in details in an existing outline.
- **Limitations:**
  - Creative writing can feel formulaic, especially in smaller parameter versions.
- **Example Use:**
  - "Generate a list of character motivations and relationships based on this story summary."

---

#### **3. Falcon (7B, 40B)**
- **Strengths:**
  - Highly efficient and performant for its parameter size.
  - The 40B version is robust for creative and logical tasks alike, while 7B works for shorter tasks.
- **Best For:**
  - Scene breakdowns, character interactions, and creative brainstorming.
- **Limitations:**
  - The smaller versions may lack depth for complex narratives.
- **Example Use:**
  - "Write a dialogue between a hero and their reluctant ally during a pivotal moment."

---

#### **4. Mosaic MPT (7B, 30B)**
- **Strengths:**
  - Designed for versatility and fine-tuning on specific tasks.
  - Performs well for structured outputs and shorter creative prompts.
- **Best For:**
  - Plot structuring, subplots, and short scene generation.
- **Limitations:**
  - Long-form storytelling may lack cohesion without fine-tuning.
- **Example Use:**
  - "Describe a vivid marketplace scene in a medieval fantasy world."

---

#### **5. RWKV (4B–14B)**
- **Strengths:**
  - Lightweight and efficient on smaller hardware.
  - Good for maintaining context in shorter conversations or scene-level tasks.
- **Best For:**
  - Scene-level planning, dialogue generation, or short story snippets.
- **Limitations:**
  - Limited ability to handle complex or deeply layered narratives.
- **Example Use:**
  - "Generate a short conversation between a villain and their henchman about their next plan."

---

#### **6. BLOOM (3B, 7.1B, 176B)**
- **Strengths:**
  - Multilingual capabilities and logical reasoning.
  - The 7.1B version works well for structured tasks and simpler creative writing.
- **Best For:**
  - Multilingual story generation, logical outlines, and cultural worldbuilding.
- **Limitations:**
  - Not as refined for creative storytelling compared to larger models.
- **Example Use:**
  - "Generate a folktale in the style of [specific culture] based on this synopsis."

---

### **Considerations for Consumer Models**

#### **Parameter Size and Task Suitability**
- **3B–7B Parameters:**
  - Best for simple and short tasks: outlines, lists, short descriptions.
  - Ideal when running on constrained hardware.
- **13B–40B Parameters:**
  - Capable of more complex storytelling and maintaining moderate context.
  - Suitable for scene generation, character development, and multi-paragraph continuity.
- **70B+ Parameters:**
  - Approaching higher-end capabilities for long-form narrative generation and nuanced storytelling.
  - Excellent for iterative drafting and refining.

### **Pairing Tasks with Consumer Models**

| **Task**                        | **Model Size** | **Examples**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Story Prompt Expansion**      | 7B–40B         | Falcon 7B for short expansions; LLaMA-2 13B+ for detailed expansions.       |
| **Story Structure Generation**  | 13B–70B        | Mistral 13B or LLaMA-2 13B for structured outlines with logical flow.       |
| **Character Creation**          | 7B–30B         | Mosaic MPT 30B for nuanced characters or Falcon 7B for basic personality.   |
| **Scene Breakdown**             | 7B–40B         | Falcon 40B for detailed beats or RWKV 7B for shorter scenes.                |
| **Dialogue Writing**            | 7B–40B         | Mistral 7B for concise dialogue; Falcon 40B for engaging conversations.     |
| **Worldbuilding**               | 7B–70B         | BLOOM 7B for multilingual settings; LLaMA-2 70B for detailed landscapes.    |
| **Iterative Draft Refinement**  | 30B–70B        | Falcon 40B or LLaMA-2 70B for improving coherence and polishing drafts.     |

### **Practical Notes**
- **Fine-Tuning:** Consumer-grade models often improve significantly with task-specific fine-tuning. If possible, fine-tune models on storytelling datasets.
- **Chaining Models:** For complex workflows, chain smaller models for logical tasks (e.g., LLaMA-2 13B for outlines) and larger models for creative tasks (e.g., Falcon 40B for dialogue).
- **Hardware Considerations:** Models in this range can often run on consumer-grade GPUs with 16–24 GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 3090, 4090) for 7B–13B models, and 40B–70B models may require multi-GPU setups or optimization techniques like quantization.

By carefully matching tasks to the model’s size and strength, even consumer-grade models can deliver impressive results for your storytelling process.
