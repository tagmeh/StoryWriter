Todo:
- [ ] Refactor code to clean it up and promote structure and organization.
- 
- [ ] Add logging module (Separate from logging the llm outputs as json files within the story directories.)
  - [ ] Add logging to show streamed output.
  - [ ] Add normal logging >.>
- 
- [ ] Capture and log usage data when using LM Studio
- 
- [ ] Update story output objects to either combine into a large object, OR remove top level property (won't be able to store model name with output)
  - [ ] Look into updating the story output objects/dicts to make it easier to save things like characters/locations with their details and make it easier to access them in constant time (vs looping through arrays for name=="steve")
  - [ ] Change "characters" object in scenes to show name and status and/or motive.
